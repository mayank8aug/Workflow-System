1. Clicking on any workflow will redirect the user to workflow edit page.

2. User can add/delete/edit nodes on workflow edit page and save the workflow state.

3. The title and content of any node can be edited by clicking on the text itself.

3. Shuffle button will only be visible if the workflow is completed and there is more than one node.
